# LoRaWAN Sniffer and Stinker
ENGG4812 Thesis Project - LoRaWAN Sniffer IoT Project for Network Monitoring

This repository contains the code for the network monitoring 'sniffer' and traffic generating 'stinker'.
For the sake of simplicity and due to a combination of implementation and how the C make and library dependencies function, the sniffer and stinker have been placed into their own folders for better retrieval.
